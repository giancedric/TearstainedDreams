A strange voice surrounds your head
Was it worth it?
- ...
	How many times did you say it was the last time?
	- Who are you?
		Can you smell it? The smell of familiarity.
		Of what you ran to every time you were feeling...
		Confused
		Hurt
		Happy
		It didn't matter
		You always ran to it.
		- I don't remember.
			This is who you are, Asher. You sought comfort in something that hurt you...
			and others.
			The smoke around you, this is what you lived off of.
			Years on end, no matter who told you to stop...
			You never did.
			So tell me, Asher, was the "it's just one puff" worth it?
			- ...
				Now, look at you, still searching for answers you already know.
				...
				You can't undo this.
				=> END
			- I... don't know.
