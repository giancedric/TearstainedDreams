A strange voice surrounds your head
Was it worth it?
- ...
	How many times did you say it was the last time?
	- Who are you?
		Can you smell it? The smell of familiarity.
		Of what you ran to every time you were feeling...
		Confused
		Hurt
		Happy
		It didn't matter
		You always ran to it.
		- I don't remember.
			This is who you are, Asher. You sought comfort in something that hurt you...
			and others.
			The smoke around you, this is what you lived off of.
			Years on end, no matter who told you to stop...
			You never did.
			So tell me, Asher, was the "it's just one puff" worth it?
			- ...
				Now, look at you, still searching for answers you already know.
				...
				You can't undo this.
				=> END

You hold out the gem towards the entity...
It's dark aura dissipates...
It's you..
You were only fighting... yourself..
Entity Asher : You can’t erase the past. You can only drown in it.
Asher: I can't.. I can't change the past, but I can choose what comes next.
...
Silence ran through the room.
Then he smiled.
You smiled.
Entity Asher: ...Then show me.
A faint shimmer ripples through the air, the weight on your chest feels lighter.
Entity Asher: If you believe that you can change for good, show me.
The figure begins to fade, breaking apart into small wisps of smoke.
Before he fully disappeared, he reaches out— offering you something.
- Take it
	A fragment of yourself.
	Of who you were.
	Of who you are.
	Asher receives Withered Breath
	As the last remnants of the entity vanish, the room around you shifts. The darkness recedes, the suffocating air lightens.
	The battle is over… but the journey isn’t.
